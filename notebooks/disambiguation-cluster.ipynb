       "Enable Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) in O Series On-Demand  Single Sign-On (SSO) strengthens system security and makes users' lives easier by  reducing password fatigue. SSO for Vertex Vertex® O Series On-Demand (O Series) is now available upon request from Customer Support.  Note: The process for implementing SSO requires a number of steps to be completed by Vertex  Consulting. For those who prefer it, a self-service option is planned for a later  date that will not require assistance from Vertex Consulting.  Here is the process:  1. Submit a Customer Support request to have SSO enabled on your On-Demand instance. 2. Receive confirmation that your request has been forwarded to Vertex Consulting and  has been placed in the implementation queue. 3. Vertex Consulting begins work when your request reaches the top of the queue. They  will assist you in setting up multi-partition user functionality and guide you through  user consolidation and conversion of user names.     Related articles  User consolidation"
