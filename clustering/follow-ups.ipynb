Navigate to Tools > Rate Lookup > By Jurisdiction. 2. Click next to the Jurisdictions field to display the Select Jurisdictions dialog box and select jurisdictions for  which you want to see rates. 3. To refine your search, click Advanced Search. See \"Advanced Search criteria\" in this article for details. 4. Click Search. All tax-rate data that O Series found for the criteria displays.  This example requests the tax rates for both Pennsylvania and Philadelphia and is  useful for seeing the components of the total 8% sales tax that is charged for purchases  in Philadelphia.     Look up tax rates by Tax Area ID  Searching by tax area returns only the rates for the selected Tax Area ID.  1. Navigate to Tools > Rate Lookup > By Tax Area. 2. Identify the Tax Area ID in one of these ways:   * Enter the ID in the Tax Area ID field.  * Click next to the Tax Area ID field to display the Select Tax Area ID dialog box, where you can enter either the   Tax Area ID or as much jurisdiction information as possible. Click Search, select the radio button for the Tax Area ID of interest, and click Select. 3. To refine your search, click Advanced Search. See \"Advanced Search criteria\" in this article for details. 4. Click Search. All tax-rate data that O Series found for the criteria displays.

However, the form provides greater precision in the calculation, such as allowing  catch-up withholding if needed.  Read about the Pennsylvania LST.     PA\\\\_LST forms  Pass in these multi-value forms to:  * Set the primary Pennsylvania work location if an employee works in multiple Pennsylvania  locations. * Calculate the prorated employee deduction for the local services tax (LST) in the  Pennsylvania municipalities where your company is located.  You can use these forms even if you are claiming one of the valid exemptions.      Calculation  The PA\\\\_LST forms use the following basic calculation to determine the deduction per  pay period:   Maximum annual Local Services Tax amount   ÷ Number of pay periods in a year   \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_  Round the resulting tax amount value down to the nearest penny      Use a form to set a primary work location for period-to-date tax amounts  If the period-to-date tax amount is less than the per-pay period prorated amount for  the local jurisdiction, Payroll Tax deducts the remainder of that amount during the current pay period (except as constrained  by local and statewide limits).  First, Payroll Tax checks for a combination of GeoCode and taxingLocationType with a period-to-date  amount.  If none is found, Payroll Tax uses:  * The primary work location set with PA\\\\_LST.PRIMARYWORKLOCATION.  Or  * If there is no form, Payroll Tax uses the primary work location provided in the paycheck request.      Use a form to enable catch-up withholding  The Pennsylvania Local Services Tax is subject to low-income and military exemptions.  If you use the PA\\\\_LST exemption forms, Payroll Tax factors the exemptions into the calculation and tracks the employee's year-to-date  wages.  Using the forms facilitates catch-up withholding if the wages for a previously exempt  employee exceed the low-income limit.\",\n",

You must supply this field if you do not supply paycheck requests that have year-to-date tax  amounts from past pay periods, but no gross pay for the current pay period. (The information  is needed for Payroll Tax to confirm that the statewide $52 tax limit is not exceeded.)   You can omit this form if the employee did not work for any other Pennsylvania employer  in the calendar year.      Effect on accumulation  Because this field has statewide applicability, if this form is present and populated  on any location with a Pennsylvania GeoCode and a Tax ID of 536, Payroll Tax uses this value as the statewide year-to-date total from previous employers and does  not accumulate tax amounts from other locations.      Conflicting values  If two or more work locations with PA\\\\_LST.STATE\\\\_YTD have conflicting values, calculation  ends.      PA\\\\_LST.LI\\\\_EXEMPTEDPAYPERIOD  This value displays after tax is calculated:  * 0 - A low-income exemption is not valid for this pay period * 1 - A low-income exemption is valid for this pay period  Add this return value to the year-to-date total passed in through the LI\\\\_EXEMPTEDPAYPERIODSYTD  field, in case a catch-up calculation is needed.      Change in pay period frequency  Vertex recommends that you adjust the value of PA\\\\_LST.LI\\\\_EXEMPTEDPAYPERIODSYTD to  base the catch-up calculation on a value that reflects the new pay frequency.',\n",

If you  use Vertex Certificate Center, go here.  Before creating or accessing certificates in ECP, your customer must create an account in ECP.     Account components  An ECP account has two main components:  * ECP customer - The company or organization with which you do business. The ECP customer corresponds to a customer in Vertex® O Series.  If you are using ECW for certificate creation, the customer's information prefills many of the fields  on the Buyer Information page in ECW.  * ECP user - An individual from that company or organization who uses the portal to create,  view, print, or renew certificates at an ECP location. The ECP user corresponds to a customer contact in O Series.  If you are using ECW for certificate creation, the company representative that provides a name on the  Signature Information page in ECW corresponds to the ECP user and an O Series customer contact.  A customer can have multiple users, each with their own contact information.     ECP customer identifiers  An ECP customer has several identifiers - a company name, a company code, and a company  email - that flow across the ECP, O Series, and ECW systems.  Customer's company name across systems  Your customers' company names and company representative names flow across the ECP, O Series, and ECW systems. The following table identifies how the company names and company representative  names are identified in each system:  \n",
