It's most efficient to specify transaction information  first and to then identify line-item details that differ from the transaction selections.  When working with line items, keep these guidelines in mind:  * You must identify at least one line item on either the transaction or line-item Basic  tab, but you can add any number of line items on the line-item Basic tab. * You can set up multi-component line items, so that any line item can include any number  of child line items. * Each line item must have an amount for tax calculation. * Each line item inherits selections from the level above.     Inherited properties  Each line item inherits selections from the level above, unless you specify something  different for that line item. The highest level of line items inherits the transaction-level  selections, and a child line item inherits the selections from its parent line items.  Fields that inherit values from the transaction or parent line item are identified  with .  A word about codes \\u2013 to change a code that is inherited, you can click next to the code field to select a code from the data in your O Series database. Codes and class codes are case-sensitive. Entering abc in a Code field  does not detect a match for a code of ABC. If codes that you enter are either not  defined or do not match codes in your system, tax is calculated using default rates  and rules.     The line item tabs  These are the line-item level tabs. Depending on the financial event you select, some  of the tabs may not be available. You can find descriptions for a tab by clicking  the tab link.  * Basic * Addresses * Registrations * Participants * Amounts * Input Tax * Taxability Drivers * Flex Fields * Overrides * Other * Returns Fields\",\n",
