| Vector Store        | Designed for fast cosine similarity search                   | Limited relational capabilities     |
| Graph Database      | Enables queries based on relationships                       | Limited to graph-based queries      |
| Hybrid Vector-Graph | Combines the capabilities of both vector and graph databases | Highly specialized = vendor lock-in |
| Multi-Model         | Supports multiple data models                                | Increased infrastructure complexity |

## Graph Retrieval âž¡ LLM

![pipeline](../assets/graphs/graph-retrieval.png)

Effectively, the pipeline between a graph database and an LLM has the following workflow

1. User submits a query
2. LLM used to generate a graph query from the user query
3. Graph database used to retrieve the graph query
4. Results from the graph search are flattened into a list
5. LLM used to generate a response from the list

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|Query| B[LLM]
    B -->|Graph Query| C[Graph Database]
    C -->|Graph Results: flattened| D[LLM]
    D --> A
```
