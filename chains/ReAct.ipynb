However, the form provides greater precision in the calculation, such as allowing  catch-up withholding if needed.  Read about the Pennsylvania LST.     PA\\\\_LST forms  Pass in these multi-value forms to:  * Set the primary Pennsylvania work location if an employee works in multiple Pennsylvania  locations. * Calculate the prorated employee deduction for the local services tax (LST) in the  Pennsylvania municipalities where your company is located.  You can use these forms even if you are claiming one of the valid exemptions.      Calculation  The PA\\\\_LST forms use the following basic calculation to determine the deduction per  pay period:   Maximum annual Local Services Tax amount   ÷ Number of pay periods in a year   \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_  Round the resulting tax amount value down to the nearest penny      Use a form to set a primary work location for period-to-date tax amounts  If the period-to-date tax amount is less than the per-pay period prorated amount for  the local jurisdiction, Payroll Tax deducts the remainder of that amount during the current pay period (except as constrained  by local and statewide limits).  First, Payroll Tax checks for a combination of GeoCode and taxingLocationType with a period-to-date  amount.  If none is found, Payroll Tax uses:  * The primary work location set with PA\\\\_LST.PRIMARYWORKLOCATION.  Or  * If there is no form, Payroll Tax uses the primary work location provided in the paycheck request.      Use a form to enable catch-up withholding  The Pennsylvania Local Services Tax is subject to low-income and military exemptions.  If you use the PA\\\\_LST exemption forms, Payroll Tax factors the exemptions into the calculation and tracks the employee's year-to-date  wages.  Using the forms facilitates catch-up withholding if the wages for a previously exempt  employee exceed the low-income limit.\", '   Vertex Payroll Tax Forms for Pennsylvania  Pennsylvania forms cover two tax scenarios:  * Local Services Tax - Employee lives and works in Pennsylvania * Pennsylvania-Maryland reciprocal exception - Employee lives in Pennsylvania and works in Maryland'] \n",
